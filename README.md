'Jump To Implementation' for CodeRush 
=======================

This plugin was originally requested by a customer in a [Thread on the DevExpress Forums](http://community.devexpress.com/forums/p/64210/219567.aspx)

The plugin was designed to jump to the first implementation of a method in an interface.

It has since **been obsoleted** by more than one plugin including [CR_InterfaceNav](http://github.com/rorybecker/CR_InterfaceNav)
As such, no release has been created for this plugin.
